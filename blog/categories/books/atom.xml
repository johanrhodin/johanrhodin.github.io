    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished "Teem Geek, A Software Developer's Guide to Working Well with Others" by Brian W. Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman.
It's a short read, about 160 pages, and it's spiced up with a lot of pictures, quotes and stories from the front lines of (software) engineering, which makes for an easy read.</p>

<p>The reasoning in the book is that to be able to produce a great product you need a great team, and in order to work efficiently in a team you need a good team culture. The team culture is constructed by using HRT - humility, respect and trust. And you need HRT: in the team, with the users of your product and within the organization as a whole.</p>

<p>This book does a great job of explaining and summarizing what's needed in order to build that team culture, from communication strategies, design documents, code reviews and meeting techniques to leadership skills and dealing with "difficult" people in the team.</p>

<p>I'd highly recommend this book for anyone interested in building great products with great team members.</p>
